                I'm a student at

                (University of Mohaghegh Ardabili).<br>
                This is my second semester. I was born in Mehr, 19 years old I am.<br>
                For this semester, we have to create a personal website to introduce ourselves. So here it is.
                I hope you enjoy it.

                Leaving a trace of yourself is one of the most meaningful things in this world.<br>
                Planting a tree, raising a child, or building a website like this. these things are priceless.
                I enjoy everything related to art.<br>
                I believe there's so much passion and creativity in it. it's full of life.

            <p>
                Being on your own, far from home, can be a bit hard to bear. When I first entered university,
                I was uncertain about everything and overwhelmed.

                After a while, I made some good friends — people with beautiful hearts and minds who helped me
                through this adventure.
                I feel lucky to know so many kind people that it's hard to choose just two pictures.

                When exams came, we all became bookworms. I was fascinated when I first saw original references
                like Halliday and Thomas.
                I spent most of my time in the library when I didn’t have classes.
